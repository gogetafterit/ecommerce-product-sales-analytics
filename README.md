I built this project to practice Agile and Kanban project management. I set up a Kanban board to track all tasks from backlog to completion, wrote user stories with clear acceptance criteria, estimated story points for each task, and ran sprints using milestones.

This project demonstrates hands-on experience with:

- Visual workflow management using Kanban
- Writing user stories and acceptance criteria
- Sprint planning and execution
- Progress tracking with burndown charts
- Identifying and labeling technical debt

The burndown chart was created in Excel and uploaded as an image to track sprint progress.

All project requirements are complete and ready for review.
